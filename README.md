#Â Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fernando Pastor, and I'm a seasoned professional with over 20 years of experience in graphic design, web development, and digital marketing, specializing in marketing strategies.

###Â ðŸŒŸ Adapting and Evolving

Currently, I'm embracing a new challenge by pursuing a Higher Technician degree in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM). This shift represents my commitment to continuous growth and adapting to the evolving tech landscape.

###Â ðŸ“š Background and Continuous Learning

I hold a Higher Technician degree in Audiovisual Production and a Master's in Digital Marketing and Social Media. This academic journey has enabled me to blend my creative passion with the latest trends in online marketing. Recently, I also 
earned a Professional Certification as an Occupational Training Instructor, underscoring my dedication to sharing knowledge and expertise.

Feel free to connect or explore my repositories to see my work in action!
